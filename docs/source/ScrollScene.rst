onScroll Library 
#################

The Scroll Library is built to be very similar to anime.js in that it can target either JavaScript Properties or CSS Selectors. Additionally it operates off of timelines similar to anime.js's.

Instantiate a new ScrollScene object, add your timelines to it, and then call ApplyAnimations on every onScroll.
